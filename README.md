# CausalModel

A structure for representing possible states of a causal entity (such as plot, generalized character personality, aspects of natural language grammar, etc.). Takes into account the probabilities of facts and supports real-time fixation of a specific state (e.g., it can be useful in dynamic procedural generation of a logical set of facts in a game).
